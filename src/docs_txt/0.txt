functioning and lower treatment adherence.[6] Hence, 
effective pharmacological treatment is an important 
component of treatment.[7] Pharmacological treatments 
may reduce long‑term morbidity in juvenile BD.[8] 
The use of second‑generation antipsychotics or 
second‑generation antipsychotics  (SGAs) has been 
developed because of their effectiveness and much 
lower rates of extrapyramidal side effects compared 
with old‑generation drugs.[9] However, in many cases, 
SGAs have unwanted side effects, especially Mets.[10] 
It has been shown that SGA‑related Mets is even more 
dramatic in children and adolescents than in adults 
and these patients already suffer from low self‑esteem INTRODUCTION
Juvenile bipolar disorder is a life‑long psychiatric illness 
associated with significant morbidity and increased 
mortality due to both medical comorbidities such as 
metabolic syndrome  (Mets) and high suicide rate.[1,2] 
The presence of  Mets seems to be related not only to the 
general medical status but also to the psychiatric status of 
people with bipolar disorder  (BD).[3-5] It has been reported 
that patients with comorbid BD and Mets undergo more 
hospitalizations and show poorer insight and global Background:  second-generation antipsychotics /uni00A0(SGAs) are associated with metabolic side e ﬀects in child and adolescents. /T_he aim 
of this study is to evaluate the metabolic e ﬀects of adding topiramate on aripiprazole in patients with bipolar disorder /uni00A0(BD) aged 
between 6 and 18 /uni00A0years. Materials and Methods  : A/uni00A012-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted in 
the child psychiatric units of university hospitals. Forty patients aged between 6 and 18 /uni00A0years with new diagnosis of BD participated 
in the study. Eleven patients were excluded. Subjects received aripiprazole plus topiramate /uni00A0(Group /uni00A01, n/uni00A0=/uni00A015) or aripiprazole /uni00A0(Group /uni00A02, 
n/uni00A0=/uni00A014) for a 3-month period. Young mania rating scale /uni00A0(YMRS) was used for measuring the manic symptoms severity. Primary 
outcome measures included weight, height, body mass index /uni00A0(BMI), waist circumference, abdominal circumference, and blood 
pressure. Secondary outcome measures included fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, fasting insulin, and fasting lipid proﬁle. 
Changes in metabolic proﬁle during the study were obtained by using repeated measures of variance. Results:  During a 3-month 
follow-up, YMRS measures decreased signiﬁcantly in both groups with a signiﬁcant di ﬀerence between groups /uni00A0(P/uni00A0</uni00A00.05). /T_he mean 
of weight, BMI, and high-density lipoprotein levels in group /uni00A02 were signiﬁcantly increased /uni00A0(P/uni00A0</uni00A00.05), and the mean of low-density 
lipoprotein level in group /uni00A01 was decreased /uni00A0(P/uni00A0</uni00A00.05). No signiﬁcant di ﬀerences were observed in anthropometric parameters and 
metabolic indices between groups /uni00A0(P/uni00A0>/uni00A00.05). Conclusion:  Adding topiramate on aripiprazole is e ﬀectivefor controlling bipolar 
disorder as well as metabolic adverse e ﬀects of SGAs in juvenile patients.

Arman and Haghshenas: Topiramate controls metabolic effects of aripiprazole
Journal of Research in Medical Sciences | 2022 | 2and the stigma of being different from their peers.[11] 
Nonpharmacological and pharmacological strategies have 
been approved for counteract Mets in adult population, 
but studies in child and adolescents are currently limited  to 
metformin due to safety concerns and efficacy issues of 
other medications in this population.[12,13] The objective of 
this study was to assess the metabolic effects of adding 
topiramate on aripiprazole in bipolar patients aged 
between 6 and 18  years, in a randomized, double‑blind, 
placebo‑controlled trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Regarding to previous similar studies and difference between 
two means formula  (α = 5%, d  = 2.5 and power  = 80%), 
40  new bipolar patients aged between 6 and 18  years who 
were visited or were admitted in child psychiatric units 
of hospitals affiliated with Isfahan University of Medical 
Sciences were participated in the study.
Inclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria were  lack of chronic physical illness or 
comorbid psychiatric disorder, negative history of receiving 
antipsychotic drugs or mood stabilizers or any other drugs 
that could change appetite during recent 3  months before 
the study, lack of history of allergic reaction to topiramate, 
lack of history of renal insufficiency or renal stone, and age 
between 6 and 18  years.
Exclusion criteria
Exclusion criteria were  patient’s or family’s unwillingness 
to continue participation in study, the need for 
electroconvulsive therapy  (ECT) treatment during the 
study, and any unexpected new physical illness that could 
potentially change medical care of the patient. The written 
consent was signed by parents/guardians and the assent 
was given by adolescents.
Design
This study was designed as a double‑blind, 
placebo‑controlled trial and conducted from July 2020 to 
July 2021 during 3 phases  (0, 1, 3 months). Our study was 
approved in the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University 
of Medical Sciences  (IR.MUI.MED.REC.1399.235), and 
the study protocol was registered in the Iranian Registry 
of Clinical Trials  (IRCT20200606047668N1). All the 
researchers of this study were believed in Helsinki Ethical 
principles. Study treatments were randomly assigned using 
an online computerized randomization system. Eligible 
participants received double‑blind topiramate  (Darou 
Pakhsh, IRAN) and aripiprazole  (Dr. Abidi, IRAN) as 
Group 1 or aripiprazole as Group  2 in 1:1 ratios. Starting 
dose of aripiprazole in both groups was 5  mg/day orally and increased weekly to a maximum dose of 10–30  mg/
day. Subjects in group  1 were given topiramate starting 
at 12.5 mg orally/day, which was titrated up by 12.5  mg/
week as tolerated without side effects  (nausea, vomiting 
and memory disturbances) up to a target dose of 150  mg/
day. Patients were evaluated over a 12‑week period to 
monitor psychiatric symptoms and metabolic profile and 
side effects and were instructed not to change their baseline 
diet or activity level during the study. Diagnosis of BD 
and rule‑out of other comorbid psychiatric disorders were 
made by a child and adolescent psychiatrist according to 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
5th Edition (DSM ‑5) criteria and by a semi‑structured 
diagnostic interview, using kiddie schedule for affective 
disorders and schizophrenia that provides reliable and 
valid youth psychiatric diagnoses in Iranian population.[14,15] 
Symptom severity improvement was assessed using young 
mania rating scale  (YMRS) that has adequate psychometric 
properties in the Iranian population.[16] The scale has 11 
items and is based on the patient’s subjective report of his 
or her clinical condition over the previous 48  h.
Clinical measures and safety monitoring were conducted 
during all visits. Laboratory tests for metabolic profile 
including fasting blood sugar(FBS), triglyceride(TG),chol
esterol(Chol), low‑density lipoprotein (LDL), high‑density 
lipoprotein (HDL), and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) were 
conducted at weeks 0, 4, and 12. Girls above the age 9 took a 
urine pregnancy test before initiating the research. Primary 
outcome measures included weight, height, body mass 
index (BMI), waist circumference, abdominal circumference, 
and blood pressure. Secondary outcome measures included 
lipid profile, FBS, HbA1C, fasting insulin, and fasting lipid 
profile.
Statistical analysis
After data gathering, measures analyzed with Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences  (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) 
version 14 were shown as n  (%) and mean  ± standard 
deviation  (SD). Significance determined as  P < 0.05. 
Regarding normal distribution of measurements, based on 
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Chi‑square test and independent 
t‑test were used when appropriate. For quantitative 
outcome measures, we used repeated‑measures analyzes 
of covariance after adjustment of confounding variables 
such as age, gender, history of previous hospitalization or 
substance use disorder, and the dose of aripiprazole.
RESULTS
Participants consisted of 40 new bipolar patients between 
age 6 and 18 with equal numbers in topiramate and 
placebo groups. Eleven of participants were excluded from 
study (5 in topiramate group and 6 in placebo group). Six 
Arman and Haghshenas: Topiramate controls metabolic effects of aripiprazole
Journal of Research in Medical Sciences | 2022 | 3patients were excluded due to incomplete use of drug or 
unwillingness to stay in study. Two participants excluded 
due to exacerbation of symptoms and need for ECT and 
other appropriate treatments and three patients were 
excluded due to drug side effects. In this study, one of the 
participants in control group suffered from restlessness and 
irritability after drug administration. One of participants in 
treatment group expressed dystonia. Elevated liver enzymes 
were observed in another patient in the same group during 
the study. All of them were referred for further evaluation 
and appropriate intervention  [Figure 1].
Finally, 75% of participants in Group  1 and 70% in Group  2 
completed the study. The mean age of participants that 
completed the trial was 12.93. Among these, 44.8% were 
girls. The statistical analysis did not show any significant 
difference in baseline characteristics such as age, gender, 
previous hospitalization history, educational status of the 
patients and parents, and history of metabolic disorders in 
family members between groups  [Table  1].
Groups 1 and 2 were not significantly different regarding the 
dose of aripiprazole at the baseline in time 0  (0 vs. 0 mg), after 
4 weeks in time1  (12.33 ± 4.58 mg vs. 10.89  ± 3.61 mg) and at 
the end point of study at time 2, respectively  (15.33 ± 8.12 mg 
vs. 13.57  ± 3.49 mg) (P > 0.05). Mean topiramate dose in Group 1 in time1 was 52.50  ± 27.63 mg, and at the time 2 
was 55.00  ± 27.06 mg (P > 0.05).
The severity of bipolar symptoms decreased significantly 
over a 3‑month period of time in both groups while using 
YMRS (P < 0.001). In addition, the mean  ± SD of YMRS was 
lower in Group  1 compared to Group  2 but this difference 
was only statistically significant at the time 2  (7.53 ± 4.15 vs. 
12.67 ± 7.15) (P < 0.028) [Table  2].
In pairwise comparison of all anthropometric parameters 
during time 0, time 1, and time 2, there was no significant 
difference between groups  (P > 0.05). But in Group  2, the 
mean ± SD of weight in time 2  (61.49 ± 17.84) was higher 
in comparison with time 0  (59.06 ± 18.40) with statistically 
significant difference  (P = 0.012). BMI comparison in Group  2 
has a similar pattern and statistically significant  (P = 0.016) 
different levels in time 2  (24.41 ± 4.08) compared with time 
0 (23.92 ± 4.08) [Table  3].
Finally, within‑group comparison of metabolic parameters 
concluded that the mean of LDL in Group  1 decreased 
significantly during the 3‑month follow‑up  (P = 0.015). In 
contrast, mean of HDL in Group  2 significantly increased 
during the same period of time  (P = 0.024). Comparison 
of other metabolic parameters revealed no significant

DISCUSSION
This study showed that a 3‑month treatment with 
aripiprazole  (with and without topiramate) would result 
in improvement of manic symptoms’ severity. Moreover, 
addition of topiramate to this treatment amplifies the 
aforementioned positive therapeutic effects. In addition, this study revealed that a 3‑month treatment with aripiprazole 
in placebo group was significantly associated with weight 
gain and subsequent BMI changes. Although adding 
topiramate would not result in weight loss and decrease 
in BMI, counteracts with some SGA‑induced metabolic 
adverse effects such as weight gain and morbid obesity. 
Other findings included significant decrease in LDL levels in 
Group 1 and statistically significant increase of HDL levels 
in Group  2; however, these changes were within normal 
range and would have no clinical significance. Data on 
metabolic effects of topiramate in BD of young child and 
adolescents are limited and previous studies have shown 
different results.[17-19] In 2007, Tramontina S  et al. who 
used a different methodology showed that topiramate has 
antimanic effects in adolescents and is effective in decreasing 
weight when given over  12 weeks.[20] They examined patients 
who presented with over  5% increase in their weight when 
compared with baseline, but in our study, the preventive 
effects of Topiramate were considered. Similar study by 
Li et al. in 2008 on effects of topiramate on weight and 
metabolism in children with epilepsy demonstrated that 
BMIs of children with epilepsy decreased signi ficantly 
during a 12‑week treatment period with topiramate, but 
the decrease had no correlation to the dosage of topiramate, 
suggesting that topiramate‑induced weight loss is 
independent of its dosage.[21] Similar to our study, they found 
no significant differences on plasma FBS and insulin indices 
before and after the treatment and the author concluded 
that the change of glucose metabolism could not be a key 
factor to cause decrease of weight in topiramate treatment. 
Shapiro M,  et al. who came up with similar findings[22] found 
that topiramate and zonisamide may be utilized for weight 
loss in a pediatric psychopharmacological treatment regimen 
but their participants population included epileptic patients 
and the study design was medical record review. Javad 
Mahmoudi‑Gharae et al. in 2012 compared the effects of 
topiramate versus valproate sodium as an add‑on therapy to 
a combination of lithium and risperidone  (Li + Ris) on body 
weight and serum lipid profile in children and adolescents 
with BD.[23] They found that when topiramate and valproate 
sodium are used for 6  weeks as adjunctive treatment to a 
combination of Li  + Ris, they act alike on lipid milieu of 
children and adolescents with BD. Other finding of this study 
was that Both Li  + Ris/Valproate and Li  + Ris/Topiramate 
therapies can lead to an increase in BMI z‑score. This 
increase was statistically significant with Li  + Ris/Valproate 
therapy, which suggests that topiramate could attenuate 
the ongoing weight gain from lithium and risperidone. 
However, according to the discussion in the end of their 
study, it should be emphasized that metabolic changes 
could have been potentially obscured by administration 
of the combination regimen used in this trial. In addition, 
past treatment exposures, including prior “double hit” by 
lithium and risperidone, may have influenced the result of Table  1: Baseline demographic and clinical

metabolic changes with valproate sodium and topiramate. 
Fox CK, et al. assessed the safety and efficacy of short‑term 
meal replacement therapy followed by topiramate for BMI 
reduction in adolescents with severe obesity.[24] In summary, 
their trial during 24  weeks with topiramate at a dose of 
75 mg/day demonstrated limited efficacy for BMI reduction 
in adolescents with severe obesity compared to placebo.
Animal studies have shown that topiramate could 
increase the insulin sensitivity and decrease the blood 
concentration of insulin, both of which will cause a 
loss of appetite and an increase of lipid metabolism.[25] 
Wilkes’ group found that topiramate could reduce insulin 
resistance.[26]
CONCLUSION
In summary, this trial demonstrates the efficacy of 
topiramate as adjuvant treatment for controlling BD as well 
as metabolic adverse effects of SGAs in juvenile patients. Although metabolic and anthropometric parameters 
remained in normal clinical range during this study, they Table  3: Comparison of anthropometric parameters

Arman and Haghshenas: Topiramate controls metabolic effects of aripiprazole
Journal of Research in Medical Sciences | 2022 | 6may be due to lower metabolic adverse effect of aripiprazole 
compared with other SGAs, small sample size, or short 
duration of study. The limitation of this study included large 
amount of participant dropouts in both case and control 
groups and subsequent small sample size to observe more 
clinically significant effects. Given this limitation, further 
investigations with longer follow‑up can provide more 
accurate results.
